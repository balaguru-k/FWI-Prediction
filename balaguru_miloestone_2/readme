1)Ridge Regression Model Training, Evaluation and Hyperparameter Tuning

This project trains a Ridge Regression model to handle multicollinearity, evaluates its performance using multiple metrics, and tunes the regularization parameter alpha to find the optimal model.

2)Project Features

2.1)Module 4: Model Training – Ridge Regression
- Trained a Ridge Regression model to reduce variance and handle multicollinearity.
- Performed hyperparameter tuning on the alpha value.
- Checked bias–variance tradeoff by visualizing model performance.
- Saved the trained model as ridge.pkl using pickle.
- Documented the training process and parameters used.

2.2)Module 5: Evaluation & Optimization
- Evaluated the model using:
  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
  - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
  - R² Score
- Plotted:
  - Predicted vs Actual values
  - Train MSE vs Alpha
  - Train RMSE vs Alpha
  - Train MAE vs Alpha
- Identified underfitting/overfitting based on learning patterns.
- Selected optimal alpha that gives the best accuracy.

3)Hyperparameter Tuning – Alpha

The following metrics were tracked across multiple values of alpha:

- MSE (Train)
- RMSE (Train)
- MAE (Train)

The optimal alpha is the one that provides:

✔ Low MSE  
✔ Low RMSE  
✔ Low MAE  
✔ High R² score  
✔ Balanced train vs test performance

----------------------------------------------

6) Underfitting & Overfitting Check

- Underfitting → High train error + high test error  
- Overfitting  → Low train error + high test error  
- Good Fit → Train and test errors are similar  
  (best model chosen using optimal alpha)

7)Technologies Used

- Python  
- NumPy  
- Pandas  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib  
- Pickle
